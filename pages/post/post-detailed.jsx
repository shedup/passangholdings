          Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by an anonymous person as a form of
          exchange. Initially valued at $0.00099, today a single bitcoin is a
          little over $50K. Since its inception it has gained over
          1,415,120,233.33% in value while the S & P 500 has gained 510.15%. So
          it begs the question - What makes Bitcoin so valuable that its growth
          dwarfs 500 of America’s best businesses? Can it be considered a new
          asset class or is it a successful speculative vehicle?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our economy is based around the flow of currency - dollar, yen or
          euro. The use of currency as a standard form of exchange has
          facilitated economic progress while setting a framework for prices of
          services and commodities. Thus, our currency is heavily regulated. The
          government prints it, it distributes or limits it, they like to know
          how much money you have, who you are sending it to, how, and why. On
          the contrary, Bitcoin to a certain extent cannot be regulated in the
          same manner. There is an anonymity aspect to it. It is this unique
          rebellious feature which makes it attractive to traders and investors.
          In recent times, some professionals have used that feature as a
          selling point for Bitcoin. Many traders and investors are so drawn to
          its hype that they have either forgotten or ignored that Bitcoin has
          no underlying asset that justifies any price at all. For an equity to
          be valued at any price, there has to be an underlying asset. For
          example, the share price of Amazon can be attributed to the business
          and its future outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of now, the only justification of bitcoins value is the hype and
          anticipation around it. Say I had 100 bitcoins and I had to sell it to
          you. It would be the hardest pitch of my life because there is no
          reason for you to buy it. I would have to somehow convince you to find
          the next person who can pay you more than what you paid me. This is
          what we call Greater Fool theory, finding the next greater fool. It
          has no utility to you and provides no intrinsic value to the economy
          or the society. To quote the late Charlie Munder, “its shitocurrency.”
          and Warren Buffet added “If you offered me all the bitcoin in the
          world for $25 I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it.”

          About half of transactions with cryptocurrency are between traders.
          These are people looking to make quick bucks. And if it's working for
          you I would advise you to cease, bag the profit and never trade again.
          Deciding to keep trading is similar to a gambler who wins $25,000
          after 10 years of gambling and goes back to the casino to test his
          luck only to lose all the money over the next few weeks. In that
          sense, Bitcoin is a speculative vehicle that the United States
          government has allowed to exist. And worse yet, it's not nearly as
          well studied and regulated like casinos are.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the rest of the transaction is either untraceable or is being
          used for its true use cases - money laundering, sex and human
          trafficking, and bribery. The anonymous nature of Bitcoin’s network is
          ideal for bad actors. These are people who are sanctioned in Cuba,
          Venezuela, Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. As per the FBI report,
          North Korea has used cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear research
          program. So where do we go from there?
        </p>
        <p className="mt-12">Here are a few likely future scenarios -</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario #1</strong> - If Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is to
          have a future then the government will have to regulate it and in the
          same manner as the currency. This means that each form of
          cryptocurrency will probably have to register themselves with the
          government. Here we lose the anonymity appeal. In the case of Bitcoin,
          it is nearly impossible to regulate because we don't even know who
          created it, and additionally our government doesn’t have the technical
          capabilities to backtrack and identify past transaction logs. We don’t
          have a base to work off of in order to regulate it. For example, we
          know how to regulate the restaurant business because we know the
          business inside out. Some areas of regulations being kitchen safety
          standards, food safety, fire exits, the price in the menu, and
          revenues it generates and taxes. In conclusion, if the government
          can’t regulate Bitcoin then they will probably have to shut it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario #2</strong> - Bitcoin reaches 21 million cap either
          additional bitcoins are added or everything is wiped off the market.
          No one can say with 100 percent certainty that Bitcoin will be capped
          at 21 million or so. How can investors and traders be sure that the
          creator isn’t gonna add another 21 million or erase all of it and then
          disappear again. The argument for bitcoin’s rarity is flawed because
          of its uncertainty. There is no legally binding agreement that
          necessitates the 21 million limit. Therefore, we can further debate
          whether gold and bitcoin have the same nature of rarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Bitcoin is not an asset class because of the lack of an
          underlying asset, thus, it is a successful speculative vehicle. Before
          investing in a business, the three criteria I use are - 1. Does its
          management have good character and competence? 2. What is the relation
          dynamics with its clients and consumers? 3. What is its future
          outlook? If you answer yes to all of those questions then I recommend
          you to invest in that business for a fair price. Do not invest in a
          business that you do not understand, especially a hyped up “asset” of
          which you don't even know the founder of.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a disclaimer - I may be wrong. I have been wrong before. But I also
          don't care.
