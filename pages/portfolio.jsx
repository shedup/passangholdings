      <p>
        - The majority of my investments are in Amazon. Amazon was started on
        July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos. It went public on May 15, 1997. The company
        posted its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001 and survived the
        dot-com bubble. Since then, the company has evolved from an online book
        retailer to a one-stop shop for e-commerce and also provides cloud
        computing services (34% of market share). Additionally, the company is
        diversifying to provide invaluable services through investments in
        Kuiper - broadband fast internet services, Amazon Business (office
        supplies), our fulfillment network (logistics and delivery), which is as
        big as UPS, and Amazon Pharmacy.{" "}

        Note - Amazon Prime members are eligible to get as many of the eligible
        medical prescription medications through Amazon Pharmacy RxPass for a $5
        per month flat fee.

      <h2>Permian Resources </h2>
      <p>
        - I invested in the company in 2020, and has been my longest-held
        investment. Permian Resources is an energy company focused on the
        exploration and production of oil and natural gas, primarily in the
        Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. As one of the leading
        players in one of the most prolific hydrocarbon-producing regions in the
        United States, Permian Resources leverages advanced extraction
        technologies and operational efficiencies to maximize production and
        reduce costs. With its strategic focus on the Permian Basin, known for
        its rich reserves and low extraction costs, Permian Resources is
        well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability.
